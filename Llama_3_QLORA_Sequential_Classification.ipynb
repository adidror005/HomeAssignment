        "**Model Fine-tuning with PEFT: Exploring LoRA and QLoRA**\n",
        "- Traditional fine-tuning is resource-intensive; PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning) makes the process faster and less demanding.\n",

        "\n",
        "**The Power of PEFT**\n",
        "- PEFT modifies only a subset of the LLM's parameters, enhancing speed and reducing memory demands, making it suitable for less powerful devices.\n",

        "**LoRA: Efficiency through Adapters**\n",
        "- **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA):** Injects small trainable adapters into the pre-trained model.\n",
        "- **Equation:** For a weight matrix $W$, LoRA approximates $W = W_0 + BA$, where $W_0$ is the original weight matrix, and $BA$ represents the low-rank modification through trainable matrices $B$ and $A$.\n",

        "  3. **Double Quantization:** Reduces quantization constants from 32-bit to 8-bit, saving additional memory without accuracy loss.\n",

        "1. **Padding:** Uniformly pads sequences to the length of the longest sequence using a special token, allowing simultaneous batch processing.\n",
        "2. **Batching:** Groups individual data points into batches for efficient processing.\n",
        "3. **Handling Special Tokens:** Adds necessary special tokens to sequences.\n",
